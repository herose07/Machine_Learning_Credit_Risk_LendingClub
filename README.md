# Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

For this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict credit risk using data from LendingClub. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so I had to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes.
